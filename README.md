## 🔧 DevOps & Cloud Engineering

I’m passionate about designing scalable, automated, and resilient infrastructure that empowers teams to deliver software faster and more reliably.  
Here’s what I focus on:

### ☁️ **Cloud Infrastructure**
- **Cloud Providers:** AWS, GCP – designing and managing cost-efficient, secure, and highly available infrastructure.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform & Pulumi – version-controlled, reproducible infrastructure deployments.

### ⚙️ **Automation & Orchestration**
- **Containerization:** Docker for lightweight, portable applications.
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (K8s) for running and scaling containerized workloads.
- **Configuration Management:** Ansible & Helm Charts to automate provisioning and manage application lifecycles.

### 🚀 **CI/CD Pipelines**
- **Pipeline Tools:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins.
- **Best Practices:** Automating builds, tests, and deployments to improve release velocity and reliability.

### 📊 **Monitoring & Observability**
- **Tools:** Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
- **Goal:** Ensure visibility, track metrics, and proactively detect issues before they impact users.

### 🔒 **Security & Reliability**
- **Practices:** Implementing secrets management (Vault, SSM), automated backups, and security scanning in pipelines.
- **Approach:** Shift-left security and resilience testing (chaos engineering mindset).
